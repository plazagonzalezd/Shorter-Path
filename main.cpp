/*
 Dijkstra performs a Dijkstra-find-shortest-path
 algorithm. The startNode is passed as a parameter and it
 is inserted in a heap (h); its costs, path and known
 value are modified accordingly. It's
 adjecent nodes are analyzed, and everytime a change in
 costs is made, an edgeNode is inserted into the heap.
 The heap is used to get the node that will be analyzed
 next by using deleteMin method of the heap.
 
 pre condition:  none
 post condition: the values of costs, path and known, are
 modified to their appropiate values.
